The following compression and decompress time are from my personal computer:

PROVIDED FILE:

approximate compression time:
book: 2.31 seconds
dan.bmp: 1.72 seconds
music.mp3: 1.61 seconds
music.wav: 2.77 seconds

approximate decompression time:
book.txt.huf: 4.91 seconds
dan.bmp.huf: 3.44 seconds
music.mp3.huf: 2.99 seconds
music.wav.huf: 5.31 seconds


PERSONAL FILE:

approximate compression time:
megaman8bit.jpg: 0.065 seconds
wallpaper1.jpg: 1.08 seconds
cameraImage.jpeg: 18.13 seconds

approximate decompression time:
megaman8bit.jpg.huf: 0.11 seconds
wallpaper1.jpg.huf: 1.95 seconds
cameraImage.jpeg.huf:  33.95 seconds


observation: 
1. compression and decompression time varies everytime
2. decompression time takes longer than compression time both personal and provided files
3. as the file size get larger, time grows alot
4. camera image compression and decompression is significantly higher than the provided images and images downloaded from internet
